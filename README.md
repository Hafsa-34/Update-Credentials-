ğŸ‘‰ This C++ program prompts the user to enter their username and password.

ğŸ‘‰ If the entered credentials match with the pre-set username and password, the program logs the user in successfully and gives them two options - either to change their password or to log out.

ğŸ‘‰ If the user chooses to change their password, the program prompts them to enter a new username and password, stores the new credentials, and displays them as an output.

ğŸ‘‰ If the user chooses to log out, the program terminates.

ğŸ‘‰ The program uses a while loop that continues until the user enters the correct username and password.

ğŸ‘‰ The function `function()` is called when the user wants to change their password. This function takes two parameters - the `user_name` and `password` variables - and modifies them based on the user's input.

ğŸ‘‰ Once the function is executed, the updated `user_name` and `password` are displayed as an output.

ğŸ‘‰ This code creates a basic login system in C++ and demonstrates how to modify variables using functions.
